# Find My Car 

This is the final capstone project for Microverse program. In this project, I build the front-end part of Find My Car app. This app connects to the API cars-api which I built using rails and displays a list of Cars available for sale. This app is resposive, it has also user sign-up feature and also can save user favorites from the cars list. 

## Built With
- Node js
- React
- React-Create-App
- React-router-dom
- React-redux
- Redux
- npm
- ES6
- CSS
